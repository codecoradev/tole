# Threat Model — tole

Status: initial version (2026-09-12), mapped against the OWASP Agentic/LLM
Top 10 checklist (issue #72). Every item resolves to **control** (where it
lives) / **gap** (tracked) / **N/A** (with rationale).

## Assets

| Asset | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Provider API key | `TOLE_/OPENAI_*` env | Never persisted; scrubbed from wire errors/messages |
| Session logs (JSONL) | sessions dir | Full transcript incl. tool results — local only |
| Job logs | `<workspace>/tole-jobs/` | Child stdout/stderr, attacker-influenceable content |
| Workspace files | `--workspace` dir (default cwd) | Readable AND writable by the model via tools |
| Host env of child processes | inherited by spawned commands | See ENV-1 |
| Subprocess execution authority | run_command / job_start / git / gh | The model chooses argv within argv-split + jail rules |

## Trust boundaries

1. **Provider responses → context.** The model's output becomes intent
   entries; tool args are argv-validated but otherwise untrusted.
2. **Tool results → context.** File contents, job logs, command stdout flow
   back into the transcript and are sent to the provider. A malicious
   workspace file or a compromised job subprocess can inject
   instructions here (OWASP: prompt injection).
3. **Workspace → filesystem.** File tools jail to `--workspace`
   (component-validated, TOCTOU-safe walk, #68); `run_command`/`job_start`
   run with cwd jailed but FULL process authority — the jail bounds *cwd*,
   not capability.
4. **Child env.** Spawned commands inherit the host environment by default.

## OWASP Agentic/LLM Top-10 mapping

| OWASP item | Status | Where / rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt injection (direct/indirect) | **control + documented residual** | Tool results on the wire are wrapped in `TOOL_RESULT_BEGIN/END` fences with inner fence markers neutralized (this fix); secrets scrubbed (E11). Residual: an injected instruction inside data can still steer the model — no framework fully solves this; delimiters + user-visible tool audit lines (`what: …`) limit blast radius. |
| Insecure output handling | **control** | Same fence treatment; result sizes capped (read_file 1 MiB cap, run_command 4000/2000 chars, job_poll 8 KiB window). |
| Excessive agency / tool misuse | **control (defense-in-depth) + documented residual** | Primary control: the per-call approval gate (every non-ReadOnly spawn needs consent). Secondary: `check_destructive_argv` blocklist refuses headline catastrophic patterns (teardown tools, recursive rm escaping the workspace, wrapper-nested variants) in BOTH `run_command` and `job_start`. The blocklist is best-effort by nature — wrapper/interpreter bypasses (`sudo apt ...`, `timeout 5 dd ...`, `find / -delete`, `python -c rmtree`) are expected and accepted residual risk; a real argv sandbox is a different product and explicitly out of scope. |
| Sensitive data disclosure (env) | **gap → fixed here (ENV-1)** | Children now inherit a scrubbed env: any var whose name contains `API_KEY` or `SECRET` is removed (`GITHUB_TOKEN` kept for gh/git auth — documented trade-off). |
| Supply chain (deps) | **control** | Cargo Audit + Trivy FS Scan required by rulesets on every PR and push. |
| Resource exhaustion | **control + fixed here (JOB-2)** | Provider 120 s timeout, subprocess 30 s ceiling, step budget 32, loop guard, read caps; job logs now truncated at poll when >10 MiB (unbounded disk growth previously possible while unpolled). |
| Session/message tampering | **control** | Append-only JSONL, CAS state transitions, seq monotonicity, torn-line recovery with truncation (#68); compaction never drops entries. |
| Injection via config | **N/A → control** | `.cora.yaml`/session headers are owner-controlled files; MCP (future, #74) adds an untrusted-config surface and MUST re-open this row. |
| Identity & authz of sub-agents | **N/A** | tole v0 is single-agent, single-tenant. |
| Human oversight | **control** | Risk-tiered approval gate (every non-ReadOnly call; Destructive never auto-allowed), #68 closed the replay-without-consent hole. |

## Deliberate limitations (documented, not fixed)

- **`GITHUB_TOKEN` stays in child env** — gh/git push auth needs it; the
  token can therefore be read by any command the model runs. Mitigating
  context: the model already holds provider credentials for its own API
  calls by necessity; both are operator-scoped secrets on a
  single-operator host.
- **Workspace width is the operator's choice** — `--workspace /` is
  technically possible and a terrible idea; the flag validates existence,
  not sanity. Documented in CONTRIBUTING.
- **Symlink swap inside `tole-jobs/`** — requires a local attacker with
  write access to the operator's workspace, at which point host
  compromise is already achieved. Jobs dirs are created 0700 to reduce
  exposure; no further control planned.
- **Injection residual** (above) — fences are a mitigation, not immunity;
  the model must still treat fenced content as data.

## Follow-ups (filed)

- Per-call Destructive classification heuristics (from RC-1) — needs a
  design discussion before code.
- MCP (#74) re-opens: untrusted tool descriptions, server-supplied env,
  network transport. Trust model must be extended there BEFORE any MCP
  code lands.
